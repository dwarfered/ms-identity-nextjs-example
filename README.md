# Enable your Next.js single-page application to sign-in users and call APIs with the Microsoft identity platform
A sample to demonstrate the fundamentals of modern authentication with Microsoft identity platform in NextJS using MSAL React.

The [Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview), incorporating [Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/entra/fundamentals/whatis) (Azure AD) and [Azure Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) (Azure AD B2C) plays a pivotal role in the Azure cloud ecosystem.
This example is designed to showcase the basics of modern authentication within a Next.js framework, utilising the [Microsoft Authentication Library for React](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-react) (MSAL React).
